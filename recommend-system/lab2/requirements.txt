Lab 1
Problem: Fresh from college, you have been hired as a junior developer at Nile Movie Rental. Recently, your company launched a movie rating site.
You have been assigned to build a movie recommendation PoC. Your company architect recommends Python language for its simplicity,
popularity both in industry and  scientific community.

To get you started, the following  input is given to you at the beginning of the assignment:

1. Distance metrics to  explore in your PoC
- Manhattan
- Euclidean
- Minkowski

2. Sample customer test data is provided to you as a Python dictionary


users = {"Angelica": {"Blues Traveler": 3.5, "Broken Bells": 2.0,
        "Norah Jones": 4.5, "Phoenix": 5.0,
         "Slightly Stoopid": 1.5,
        "The Strokes": 2.5, "Vampire Weekend": 2.0},
        "Bill": {"Blues Traveler": 2.0, "Broken Bells": 3.5,
        "Deadmau5": 4.0, "Phoenix": 2.0,
        "Slightly Stoopid": 3.5, "Vampire Weekend": 3.0},
        "Chan": {"Blues Traveler": 5.0, "Broken Bells": 1.0,
        "Deadmau5": 1.0, "Norah Jones": 3.0,
        "Phoenix": 5, "Slightly Stoopid": 1.0},
        "Dan": {"Blues Traveler": 3.0, "Broken Bells": 4.0,
        "Deadmau5": 4.5, "Phoenix": 3.0,
        "Slightly Stoopid": 4.5, "The Strokes": 4.0,
        "Vampire Weekend": 2.0},
        "Hailey": {"Broken Bells": 4.0, "Deadmau5": 1.0,
        "Norah Jones": 4.0, "The Strokes": 4.0,
        "Vampire Weekend": 1.0},
        "Jordyn": {"Broken Bells": 4.5, "Deadmau5": 4.0, "Norah Jones": 5.0,
        "Phoenix": 5.0, "Slightly Stoopid": 4.5,
        "The Strokes": 4.0, "Vampire Weekend": 4.0},
        "Sam": {"Blues Traveler": 5.0, "Broken Bells": 2.0,
        "Norah Jones": 3.0, "Phoenix": 5.0,
        "Slightly Stoopid": 4.0, "The Strokes": 5.0},
        "Veronica": {"Blues Traveler": 3.0, "Norah Jones": 5.0,
        "Phoenix": 4.0, "Slightly Stoopid": 2.5,
        "The Strokes": 3.0}
        }


  Expected fro you:
  Keep it simple.  In the demo of your PoC, you are expected to clarify the following:
  - Explain which distance metric you selected and why
  - Show sample  recommendation  results
  - Show how you handle corner cases, for example a case when there is nothing to recommend
  - Lessons learnt and info about next steps
